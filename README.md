My java solution to this problem. I used text file inputs for the inputs. If you use the code in Intellij you have to put the text files 
in the workspace directory in order for the code to work as is. I'm not sure how it would work for eclipse. I imagine it's the same deal though.
This was very confusing and tough at first because I thought I would have to do the permutations and check them manually. There's a recursive
function on the wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derangement that made this problem a lot easier. Once I figured that out, it was 
pretty plug and chug.
